# Hi there! I'm Jeff :wave:

I'm an experienced frontend software engineer with a keen attention to details and an eye for user interface design. I do enjoy my working and spare time by either coding or going through other's code to improve and learn new things.

You may find me on most popular social networks by looking up my username _**jmosawy**_, or feel free to say _hi_ by emailing me at [me@jmosawy.com](mailto:me@jmosawy.com)
